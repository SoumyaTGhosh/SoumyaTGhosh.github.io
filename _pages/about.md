I am a research scientist at [IBM Research, Cambridge](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/cambridge/) and the [MIT-IBM Watson AI lab](http://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu). I work on developing statistical models for understanding and explaining images, text, and noisy, real world healthcare data.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Brown University, where I was advised by [Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth). Before Brown, I spent a few years in beautiful Boulder getting a master's degree from the University of Colorado. At Colorado, I was advised by Jane Mulligan. Going further back, I went to the University of Mumbai (Bombay) (KJSCE) as an undergrad. I also spent a year as a postdoctoral scientist at the now defunct Disney research, Cambridge.

# Recent Highlights
 - New NeurIPS [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12669.pdf) on fast and accurate approximations to cross-validation and jackknife for models with spatial and temporal structure.
 - New [work](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20153510v1) documenting our progress on building statistical models of the progression of Parkinson's disease appeared at MLHC 2020. Our work was highlighted in several popular media articles. [DigitalTrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/ibm-michael-j-fox-parkinsons/), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/06/ibm-details-research-on-ai-to-measure-parkinsons-disease-progression/), [TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ai-and-machine-learning-facilitate-pioneering-research-on-parkinsons/).
 - [Work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06168v1.pdf) on combing posterior distributions trained on sequestered data appeared at ICML 2020.
 - A comprehensive [overview](http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/19-236.html) of learning Bayesian neural networks with Horseshoe priors will appear in JMLR.
 - New [code](https://github.com/ishanashastri/py-ddcrpMeshSeg) release for distance dependent Chinese restaurant processes. The code by Ishana Shastri is an efficient, python translated, version of this old MATLAB [package](https://github.com/SoumyaTGhosh/ddcrpMeshSeg).
