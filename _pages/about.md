I am a research scientist at [IBM Research, Cambridge](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/cambridge/) and the [MIT-IBM Watson AI lab](http://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu). I work on developing statistical models for understanding and explaining images, text, and noisy, real world healthcare data.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Brown University, where I was advised by [Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth). Before Brown, I spent a few years in beautiful Boulder getting a master's degree from the University of Colorado. At Colorado, I was advised by Jane Mulligan. Going further back, I went to the University of Mumbai (Bombay) (KJSCE) as an undergrad. I also spent a year as a postdoctoral scientist at the now defunct Disney research, Cambridge.

# Recent Highlights
 - A comprehensive [overview](http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/19-236.html) of learning Bayesian neural networks with Horseshoe priors will appear in JMLR.
 - New [code](https://github.com/ishanashastri/py-ddcrpMeshSeg) release for distance dependent Chinese restaurant processes. The code by Ishana Shastri is an efficient, python translated, version of this old MATLAB [package](https://github.com/SoumyaTGhosh/ddcrpMeshSeg).
 - Our [Work](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9277-statistical-model-aggregation-via-parameter-matching) on using Bayesian non-parametric *meta models* for fusing local models will appear at NeurIPS 2019.
 - Commonly used metrics such as test log likelihoods can be misleading indicators of posterior quality of BNNs. [Preliminary work](http://soumyaghosh.com/publications/papers/Yao19.pdf) will appear at Uncertainty and Robustness workshop at ICML' 19.
